git init
rm -rf .git    to delete (master)
git init       to get back (master)

git add .      a command that saves all files
git log command to check a history of our commits (saved files)

git status     command that shows us which files in current directory
git status  command to check the status of our files, if they are added or not.

COMMIT MEANS SAVE FILES AND ADD MESSAGE
git commit -m "message"    command that commits the files to the local repository

git push   command that pushes the files to the remote repository

IN GIT, WE HAVE 3 STAGES:
   1. WORKING STAGES - FILES THAT ARE NOT ADDED
   2. STAGING - AFETR WHEN WE RUN COMMAND "GIT ADD ." - NOW FILES ARE STAGED
   3. COMMIT - COMMITED (SACED FILES)

3 STATES OF FILES:
   1. UNMODIFIED - 
   2. MODIFIED
   3. STAGED


in the file itself after you done changes run "CTRL + S" to save file


WHEN WE RUN COMMAND "git log" WE SEE:
 1. COMMIT ID (SHA/HASH)
 2. (HEAD -> master) - IT MEANS YOU BRANCH THAT YOU WORK ON, AND LAST COMMIT
 3. AUTHOR - WHO MADE THE COMMIT
 4. DATE - WHEN THE COMMIT WAS MADE
 5. COMMIT MESSAGE -WHAT THE COMMIT IS ABOUT

git restore --staged file_name   command to get back from modified stage
git commit --amend  command to edit the message of the commit

HOW DO WE DELETE COMMIT?
1. GET THE ID OF THE COMMIT THAT YOU WANT TO DELETE  
$ git log --oneline
2. RUN COMMMAND "git reset id_of_the_commit"

git rebase     -rebrace to rewrite the history of the commit
git rebase -i --root
git branch -a command to show all existing branches
git checkout -b "branchname" to create a branch 
git checkout "desired_branch" - command to switch between branches
git merge "branchname" - command to merge second branch to master/main. Command has to be done from the main/master branch.
git flow - (ПОТОК) stratege how all companies work:
    1. Off of main/master we create a feature branch ( it has a code from our main branch)
    2. We do our work in the feature branch
    3. When we are finished we merge the feature branch to the main/master branch
    4. And than delete the feature branch
git clean -f   command to delete all untracted FILES
git clean -d -F command to delete all untrackted FOLDER
