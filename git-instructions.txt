git add .      a command that saves all files
git log command to check a history of our commits (saved files)

git status     command that shows us which files in current directory

COMMIT MEANS SAVE FILES AND ADD MESSAGE
git commit -m "message"    command that commits the files to the local repository

git push   command that pushes the files to the remote repository

IN GIT, WE HAVE 3 STAGES:
   1. WORKING STAGES - FILES THAT ARE NOT ADDED
   2. STAGING - AFETR WHEN WE RUN COMMAND "GIT ADD ." - NOW FILES ARE STAGED
   3. COMMIT - COMMITED (SACED FILES)

3 STATES OF FILES:
   1. UNMODIFIED - 
   2. MODIFIED
   3. STAGED


in the file itself after you done changes run "CTRL + S" to save file


WHEN WE RUN COMMAND "git log" WE SEE:
 1. COMMIT ID (SHA/HASH)
 2. (HEAD -> master) - IT MEANS YOU BRANCH THAT YOU WORK ON, AND LAST COMMIT
 3. AUTHOR - WHO MADE THE COMMIT
 4. DATE - WHEN THE COMMIT WAS MADE
 5. COMMIT MESSAGE -WHAT THE COMMIT IS ABOUT

git restore --staged file_name   command to get back from modified stage
git commit --amend  command to edit the message of the commit

HOW DO WE DELETE COMMIT?
1. GET THE ID OF THE COMMIT THAT YOU WANT TO DELETE  
$ git log --oneline
2. RUN COMMMAND "git reset id_of_the_commit"

git rebase     -rebrace to rewrite the history of the commit
git rebase -i --root
git branch -a command to show all existing branches
git checkout -b "branchname" to create a branch 
 git checkout "desired_branch" - command to switch between branches
